# Python physics simulation

This algorithm uses [verlet integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration)

Verlet integration is a numerical method used to integrate Newton's equations of motion. It is frequently used to calculate trajectories of particles in molecular dynamics simulations and computer graphics.

The code is implemented using PyGame.
